SERVER:\
Unless you type in ./server and a port number, the program will not run. If you type in a port number that is already being used, the program will not run and print an error message saying \'93\CocoaLigature0 ERROR on binding: Address already in use\'94.  For example, you must type in ./server 1111 for the program to work.\
\
CLIENT:\
You must type in ./client, the IP address or local host, and the port server. For example to connect to the server given in the previous example, ./client localhost 1111. If the server is not set up, the client will attempt to reconnect every three seconds while printing out \'93Attempting to connect to the server\'85\'94 \
\
Once the server and client are connected, you will be prompted to type in either open, start, exit. For open you must type in open and an account name. For example, typing in \'93open john\'94, will open the account john. \
If you type in a command that is not open and an account name, start and an account name that has not been created, then an error message will appear saying \'93Invalid input\'94.  Typing in exit prompts a message to the server,  \'93Client disconnected\'94.  \
\
After the account is created, typing in start an an account has been made, it will open up a new menu saying type in credit amount, debit amount, balance, and finish. For example, typing in credit 100. The account will be credited 100. If you type in debit 200, it will say insufficient funds. If you type in balance, the balance will show 100. If you type in a debit amount that exceeds the amount in credit, you will be prompted with a message saying there is an insufficient amount of funds. Typing in finish will exit you to the previous menu asking to open account and start account. \
\
While this is going on, the server will continuously print out the account list including: name, amount, and whether or not its in session.\
\
If you try to access an account that is in session, you will be prompted a message saying that the account is in session.\
\
The only two times you cannot create an account is while the server is printing the account list, and while someone else is creating an account.\
\
If you close the server by hitting control c, all clients will exit.\
\
If you close a client either using control c as well as typing in exit in the main menu, the server is still running. }
